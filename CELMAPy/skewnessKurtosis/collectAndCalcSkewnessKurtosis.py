    Class for collecting and calcuating skewness and kurtosis of the time 
    traces

    Skewness
    --------
    Negative skew: The left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution
    is concentrated on the right of the figure.
    For a pure Gaussian the skewness is 0.

    Kurtosis
    --------
    The kurtosis of any univariate normal distribution is 3.
    Kurtosis less than 3: Platykurtic: The distribution produces fewer
    and less extreme outliers than a gaussian.
    Kurtosis greater than 3: Leptokurtic: Tails approaches zero slower than a
    Gaussian (more extreme outliners).
